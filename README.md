# Phase II: Finetuning an OpenAI Base Model
A follow up article is currently (as of May 2025) being completed. In the article, we focus on evaluating the finetuning capabilities of OpenAI models. We seek to answer the following question: Does fine-tuning a base model with past policy data make it better than a general-purpose foundation model?

The resulting academic article was presented at the [2025 ICCP Conference](https://www.ippapublicpolicy.org/conference/icpp7-chiang-mai-2025/21) and is under peer review for publication (as of September 2025).
